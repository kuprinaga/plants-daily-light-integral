Method

This is essentially what we're doing:

Measure the light intensity (in foot-candles or PPFD) at regular intervals throughout the day (traditionally measured every hour)

Convert foot-candles to PPFD (if necessary: you wonâ€™t need to do this if you already measured PPFD using a PAR meter)

Calculate DLI from daily average PPFD
