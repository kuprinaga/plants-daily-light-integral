**Method**

This is essentially what we're doing:

- Measure the light intensity (in foot-candles or PPFD) at regular intervals throughout the day (traditionally measured every hour)

- Convert foot-candles to PPFD (if necessary: you wonâ€™t need to do this if you already measured PPFD using a PAR meter)

- Calculate DLI from daily average PPFD

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
